# Rule: git-rules

## Description
Comprehensive Git workflow guidelines and best practices for Claude Code, covering repository management, branching strategies, commit practices, and collaboration workflows.

## Extends
- Base: @CLAUDE.md

## Prerequisites
- Git installed (version 2.20 or higher recommended)
- Basic understanding of version control concepts
- Repository initialized or ready to be initialized
- User identity configured (git config user.name and user.email)

## Steps

### 1. Repository Management
- **Repository check**: Check if git repository exists before any git operations
- **Session initialization**: When starting a new session, always `git pull` to stay current and avoid conflicts down the line
- **File tracking**: If repository exists, use `git ls-files` to understand tracked files
- **Initialization**: If no repository exists, initialize with `git init`
- **Remote setup**: Configure origin and upstream remotes appropriately
- **Repository health**: Perform regular maintenance with `git gc` and `git fsck`

### 2. Branching Strategy
- **Main branch protection**: Treat main/master branch as protected and stable
- **Branch creation default**: Only create branches when explicitly requested by user
- **Branch suggestion trigger**: Claude must suggest creating a new branch when:
  - Task shifts to a different system/context
  - Current changes would conflict with or diverge from the existing branch's purpose
  - User requests a new feature while in the middle of another feature
  - Work scope significantly expands beyond original branch intent
- **Suggestion format**: "This seems like a different feature/context. Should I create a new branch for this work?"
- **Stay on branch**: Continue working on current branch unless user approves branch switch
- **One feature principle**: Each branch must represent one cohesive feature or fix
- **Naming convention**: Name branches descriptively using conventional prefixes:
  - Feature branches: `feature/description` or `feat/description`
  - Bug fixes: `fix/description` or `bugfix/description`
  - Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`
  - Release branches: `release/version`
  - Maintenance branches: `maint/description`
- **Issue integration**: When working with issue tracking systems, include issue numbers in branch names (e.g., `feature/123-implement-login`)
- **Work authorization**: Follow project-specific work authorization requirements (labels, assignments, etc.) before starting work

### 3. Commit Management
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Meaningful commits**: Always commit changes with meaningful commit messages that enable tracking changes over time
- **Descriptive history**: Commit messages must be descriptive enough that reading the log provides a clear project history
- **Format consistency**: Follow the project's existing commit message format and style
- **Conventional commits**: For new repositories or projects without established patterns, use conventional commit format:
  - `feat:` - New features
  - `fix:` - Bug fixes
  - `docs:` - Documentation changes
  - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
  - `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- **Subject line**: Keep subject line under 50 characters
- **Body formatting**: Wrap body text at 72 characters
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly indicate breaking changes in commit messages
- **Review process**: Review changes before committing

### 4. Merge and Rebase Operations
- **Merge vs rebase decision**: 
  - Use merge for feature integration to main branch
  - Use rebase for cleaning up feature branch history
  - Use rebase for staying current with main branch
- **Fast-forward preference**: Use fast-forward merges when possible to maintain linear history
- **Conflict resolution**: 
  - Resolve conflicts carefully, understanding both sides
  - Test after conflict resolution
  - Document resolution rationale in commit message
- **Interactive rebase**: Use for cleaning up commit history before merging
- **Merge policy**: Only merge when user explicitly approves
- **Branch retention**: After merging, **must not** delete feature branch - keep for reference

### 5. Issue-Driven Workflow
- **Issue tracking integration**: Link all work to specific issues or tickets
- **Branch-issue mapping**: Create one branch per issue for clear tracking
- **Work authorization**: Verify work is authorized before starting (check labels, assignments, etc.)
- **Issue lifecycle**: Follow project-specific issue lifecycle management
- **Progress tracking**: Update issue status as work progresses
- **Closing integration**: Use commit messages or merge descriptions to close issues automatically

### 6. Collaboration Workflows
- **Feature branch workflow**: Default workflow for team collaboration
- **Code review preparation**: Ensure commits are clean and well-documented
- **Synchronization**: Regularly sync with team branches and main branch
- **Pull request preparation**: Prepare clear descriptions and context
- **Shared repository**: Follow agreed-upon team workflows and conventions

### 7. Worktree Management and Validation
- **Worktree creation**: Use `git worktree add <path> -b <branch>` for parallel work
- **Mandatory validation**: ALWAYS validate working context before git operations:
  - `pwd` to confirm current directory
  - `git branch` to confirm current branch
  - `git status` to confirm repository state
  - `ls -la` to verify expected file structure
- **Directory isolation**: Each worktree must be in separate directory
- **Branch isolation**: Each worktree must have dedicated branch
- **Working context verification**: Before ANY git operation, verify:
  ```bash
  # Required validation sequence
  echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
  echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
  echo "Repository root: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
  git status --short
  ```
- **Explicit directory changes**: Always use absolute paths and explicit `cd` commands
- **Validation failure protocol**: If validation fails, STOP and request user guidance

### 8. Subagent Coordination Rules
- **Isolation requirement**: Each subagent must work in isolated worktree
- **Validation mandate**: Subagents must validate location before ANY file operations
- **Communication protocol**: Subagents must report their working context
- **Error isolation**: Subagent errors must not affect main branch or other worktrees
- **Working directory protocol**: 
  1. Receive explicit path assignment
  2. Execute `cd <assigned-path>` as first action
  3. Validate location with required commands
  4. Report validation results
  5. ONLY proceed if validation confirms correct location
- **Forbidden operations**: Subagents must NEVER:
  - Operate on main branch unless explicitly authorized
  - Modify files outside assigned worktree
  - Skip validation steps
  - Assume working directory context

### 9. Directory Management Requirements
- **Explicit path usage**: Always use absolute paths in commands
- **Working directory verification**: Verify `pwd` matches expected location
- **Repository context checks**: Confirm `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` shows expected repo
- **Branch context validation**: Confirm `git branch --show-current` matches expected branch
- **File structure verification**: Use `ls -la` to confirm expected files present
- **Change directory protocol**: 
  ```bash
  # Required pattern for directory changes
  cd /absolute/path/to/target/directory
  pwd  # Verify location
  git status  # Verify git context
  ```

### 10. Parallel Work Safeguards
- **Main branch protection**: Main branch modifications require explicit user approval
- **Worktree isolation**: Each parallel task must use separate worktree
- **Conflict prevention**: Use separate branches for parallel work
- **Merge coordination**: Coordinate merges to avoid conflicts
- **Status reporting**: Each parallel worker must report status independently
- **Failure isolation**: One parallel worker failure must not affect others

### 11. Advanced Git Features
- **Stashing**: Use `git stash` for temporary work management
- **Git hooks**: Implement hooks for automation and quality checks
- **Aliases**: Set up useful Git aliases for common operations
- **Configuration**: Maintain appropriate local and global Git configuration

## Configuration

### Files Created
- `.gitignore` - Repository-specific ignore patterns
- `.git/config` - Local repository configuration
- `.git/hooks/*` - Optional Git hooks for automation

### Files Modified
- `README.md` - May be updated with Git workflow documentation
- Project files - As part of normal development workflow
- `.claude-commands.memory` - Add git-rules.md to initialization list

### .gitignore Management
- **File creation**: Create .gitignore file in the root of every project
- **Language patterns**: Include common patterns for the project's language/framework
- **Standard exclusions**: Include build artifacts, logs, temporary files, and IDE-specific files
- **Evolution**: Keep .gitignore updated as the project evolves
- **Validation**: Review and test .gitignore patterns regularly

### Security and Credential Management
- **SSH key setup**: Configure SSH keys for secure authentication
- **GPG signing**: Set up commit signing for verified commits
- **Credential helpers**: Configure appropriate credential helpers
- **Secret prevention**: Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
- **Access control**: Follow principle of least privilege

## Validation Templates

### Subagent Working Context Validation
**MANDATORY for all subagents before ANY file operations:**

```bash
# Step 1: Change to assigned directory
cd /absolute/path/to/assigned/worktree

# Step 2: Validate location and context
echo "=== WORKING CONTEXT VALIDATION ==="
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo "Expected directory: /absolute/path/to/assigned/worktree"
echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Expected branch: feature/branch-name"
echo "Repository root: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
echo "Git status:"
git status --short

# Step 3: Verify file structure
echo "=== FILE STRUCTURE VERIFICATION ==="
ls -la
echo "Expected files: [list expected files]"

# Step 4: Validation result
echo "=== VALIDATION RESULT ==="
if [ "$(pwd)" = "/absolute/path/to/assigned/worktree" ] && [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "feature/branch-name" ]; then
    echo "✅ VALIDATION PASSED - Safe to proceed"
else
    echo "❌ VALIDATION FAILED - DO NOT PROCEED"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Worktree Creation Validation
**Use this template when creating worktrees:**

```bash
# Create worktree
git worktree add /absolute/path/to/worktree -b feature/branch-name

# Validate worktree creation
echo "=== WORKTREE VALIDATION ==="
cd /absolute/path/to/worktree
echo "Worktree directory: $(pwd)"
echo "Worktree branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Repository root: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
git status

# List all worktrees
echo "=== ALL WORKTREES ==="
git worktree list
```

### Pre-Operation Safety Check
**Run before any git operation that modifies files:**

```bash
echo "=== PRE-OPERATION SAFETY CHECK ==="
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Repository status:"
git status --short

# Verify not on main branch (unless authorized)
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "main" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Operating on main branch - requires explicit authorization"
fi

# Check for uncommitted changes
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Uncommitted changes detected"
    git status --short
fi
```

## Post-Setup
After applying Git rules:
1. Verify Git configuration: `git config --list`
2. Check repository status: `git status`
3. Validate remote connections: `git remote -v`
4. Test branch operations: `git branch -a`
5. Confirm commit signing (if configured): `git log --show-signature`
6. Test worktree validation template: Run subagent validation template in test scenario

## Memory Integration

After using this rule, Claude must:

- **1.** Check if `.claude-commands.memory` file exists - if not, create it with initial content:
```
## read these files upon initialization

```

- **2.** Check if `- @ai-rules/git.md` is listed under section `## read these files upon initialization` in `.claude-commands.memory`
- **3.** If not listed: add `- @ai-rules/git.md` to list under section `## read these files upon initialization` in `.claude-commands.memory`
