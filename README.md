# AI Priming

A comprehensive framework for establishing consistent AI assistant behavior across all software development projects through universal rules and reusable commands.

## Important Disclaimer

**This repository serves as an example implementation** of a modular AI assistant priming framework. The specific rules and documentation are highly tailored to particular technologies and workflows including:

- **NetBox** for network documentation and device management
- **VyOS** for network device configuration
- **Ansible** for automation workflows
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for Claude Code integrations
- **Python with uv** for modern Python development
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development

**Before using this framework:**

1. **Review all rules and documentation** in `ai-rules/` and `ai-docs/` directories
2. **Adapt or replace technology-specific rules** to match your environment and stack
3. **Customize the universal rules** in `CLAUDE.md` to fit your organization's standards
4. **Modify or remove** rules that don't apply to your use case
5. **Add new rules** for technologies and workflows specific to your projects

This framework demonstrates the **modular approach and structure** for AI assistant priming, but the content should be tailored to your specific needs, technologies, and organizational requirements.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to create a single source of truth for AI assistant configuration, ensuring consistent, secure, and efficient development practices across all project types. It provides a hierarchical rule system where universal principles are extended by language-specific and project-specific requirements.

## Implemented Features

  - Communication standards for concise, direct responses
  - Safety guidelines and ethical boundaries
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Error handling and recovery strategies
  - Continuous improvement guidelines
  - Professional formatting with consistent structure and cross-references

### ✅ Version Control Rules
- Automatic Git repository detection and initialization
- Meaningful commit messages for tracking project history
- Feature branch workflow with protection for main branch
- Branch persistence after merging for reference
- Proper use of `git ls-files` for repository awareness

### ✅ Language-Specific Requirements
- **Python**: Mandatory uv usage for all Python operations
  - No virtual environments or package installations
  - Ephemeral environments with uvx and uv run
  - Modern dependency management with pyproject.toml

  - ESLint and Prettier integration
  - Proper build and test scripts in package.json
  - Type-first development approach

### ✅ Command Infrastructure
- `ai-rules/` directory with specialized workflows:
  - Ansible automation and playbook management
  - NetBox network documentation and management
  - Python development best practices
  - TypeScript development workflows
  - VyOS network device configuration
- Universal testing and secrets management integrated into main CLAUDE.md
- Command template documentation and best practices
- Support for reusable workflows
- Command inheritance system

### ✅ Setup Automation
- `setup.sh` script for automatic symlink creation
- Support for both global (~/.claude/) and per-project configurations
- Idempotent setup process (safe to run multiple times)

### ✅ Claude Hooks Integration
- Comprehensive hooks system for automation and safety
- Command logging and git operation validation
- File modification monitoring for important files
- Automatic code formatting when supported tools are available
- Rule refresh system with command memory tracking
- Periodic assistant context refresh based on used commands

## Rule Hierarchy

1. **Universal Rules** (root CLAUDE.md) - Always apply
2. **Language-Specific Rules** - Apply when using specific languages
3. **Project-Specific Rules** - Extend universal rules for individual projects
4. **Rule Templates** - Modular workflows in `ai-rules/`
5. **User Instructions** - Session-specific overrides

## Getting Started

### Setting Up a New Project

**⚠️ Important: Review and customize the rules before use!** This example contains technology-specific configurations that may not apply to your project.

To use this AI priming framework in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aibix0001/ai-priming.git <your project folder>/.claude
```

This will create a `.claude` directory inside your project folder containing all the AI assistant configuration and rules. **This becomes the `.claude` folder for your new project**.

After cloning, **customize the framework**:

1. Navigate to your project folder: `cd <your project folder>`
2. **Review and edit** `.claude/ai-rules/` files to match your technology stack
3. **Update or remove** technology-specific rules (NetBox, VyOS, Ansible, etc.)
4. **Customize** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for your organization's standards
5. Start Claude Code: `claude`
6. Claude will automatically discover and use the configuration from the `.claude` directory
7. Extend with project-specific rules by creating `CLAUDE.local.md` in your project root
8. Add additional rule templates as needed

The `.claude` directory provides the foundation for consistent AI assistant behavior across your entire project development lifecycle.

## Claude Hooks System

This repository includes a comprehensive hooks system that provides:

### Automated Logging
- **Command tracking**: All bash commands are logged with timestamps
- **File monitoring**: Changes to important files (CLAUDE.md, ai-rules/, etc.) are tracked
- **Git validation**: Ensures commit messages follow conventional format standards

### Safety Features
- **Git operation validation**: Prevents dangerous operations like force pushes
- **File change alerts**: Monitors modifications to critical configuration files
- **Error prevention**: Validates command patterns before execution

### Code Quality
- **Auto-formatting**: Automatically formats code using available tools (black, prettier, shfmt)
- **Syntax validation**: Checks file syntax where applicable
- **Consistent standards**: Enforces project coding conventions

#### Supported Formatters
To enable automatic code formatting, install the following tools:
- **Python**: `uvx black` - Formats .py files (no installation needed)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript/JSON**: `npm install -g prettier` - Formats .js, .ts, .json files
- **Shell Scripts**: Install `shfmt` - Formats .sh files

The formatting hook will silently skip files if the corresponding formatter is not available.

### Rule Refresh System
- **Rule memory**: Tracks which rules have been used in the project
- **Dual refresh strategy**: Session start refresh (immediate) + periodic refresh (15-minute cooldown)
- **Context awareness**: Ensures assistant stays current with project-specific rules
- **Token optimization**: Time-based cooldown prevents context pollution from frequent refreshes

### Hook Configuration
The hooks are configured in `settings.json` and execute at specific lifecycle events:
- **PreToolUse**: Before tool execution (validation, logging)
- **PostToolUse**: After tool completion (formatting, cleanup)
- **Notification**: During notifications (rule refresh with 15-minute cooldown)

All hooks are designed to be non-blocking and provide helpful feedback without interrupting workflow.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Rule templates for common project types (Node.js, React, Next.js, Rust, etc.)
- [ ] Example projects demonstrating rule extensions
- [ ] Additional language-specific requirements
- [ ] Security audit rule templates
- [ ] Performance optimization workflows

## Contributing

New rules and workflow improvements should follow the established patterns and be thoroughly tested across different scenarios.
