# AI Planning Directory

This directory contains collaborative development plans created through structured AI assistant interactions.

## Planning Philosophy

Effective AI-assisted development benefits from a structured approach that separates planning from implementation. This directory captures plans developed through rich contextual priming followed by focused feature planning sessions.

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Context Preparation
- Supply the AI assistant with comprehensive project context
- Include relevant documentation, existing code patterns, and architectural decisions
- Establish clear requirements and constraints

### 2. Collaborative Planning
- Develop detailed plans for individual features or components
- Break down complex functionality into manageable, discrete tasks
- Document assumptions, dependencies, and implementation approaches
- Store resulting plans in this directory for reference

### 3. Implementation Sessions
- Begin each implementation with a fresh AI assistant session
- Provide the specific plan along with necessary context
- Focus on implementing one feature or component at a time
- Maintain clear boundaries between different features

## Plan Structure

Each plan should include:

- **Objective**: Clear statement of what will be built
- **Requirements**: Functional and technical requirements
- **Approach**: High-level implementation strategy
- **Tasks**: Discrete, actionable steps
- **Dependencies**: External requirements or prerequisites
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Focused Sessions**: Each implementation session has clear, bounded scope
- **Fresh Context**: Reduces potential confusion from lengthy conversation history
- **Incremental Progress**: Features develop independently with minimal interference
- **Plan Preservation**: Important decisions and reasoning remain documented
- **Iterative Refinement**: Plans can be updated based on implementation learnings

## Considerations

This methodology represents one approach to AI-assisted development that works well for certain project types and team preferences. Alternative approaches may prove more effective depending on project complexity, team dynamics, or evolving AI capabilities.

The key principle remains: **structured planning followed by focused implementation** tends to produce better outcomes than ad-hoc development, regardless of the specific workflow chosen.

## File Organization

Plans can be organized by:
- Feature area: `user-authentication-plan.md`
- Epic or milestone: `v1.0-api-design-plan.md`
- Component: `database-schema-plan.md`
- Date: `2024-01-15-search-implementation.md`

Choose a naming convention that supports your project's planning and development cycles.
